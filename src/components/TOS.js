			<h1>5 Race Street LLC Terms and Conditions</h1>
			<p>These “Terms and Conditions” last material update was made on:  June 15th, 2021.</p>
			<p>
				The 5 Race Street LLC ( “NFT.HipHop ) allows you to participate, by creating, displaying, buying and selling non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) and is made available to you by 5 Race Street LLC (“Company”).
			</p>

			<p className="number">1. Acceptance</p>

			<p>
				By connecting your NEAR wallet and using the NFT Trading market, you confirm that you understand and agree to these terms and conditions, together with any documents that may be expressly referred to and are incorporated by reference (“Terms”).
			</p>

			<p>
				These Terms constitute a legal agreement between you and Company and govern your access to and use of the NFT Trading market, including any content, functionality, and services offered on or through the website www.nft.hiphop ( the “Site”).
			</p>

			<p>
				Company reserves the right to change or modify these terms at any time and at our sole discretion. You agree and understand that by accessing or using the NFT Trading market and the Site following any change to these Terms, you are regarded as having agreed to the revised Terms.
			</p>

			<p className="number">2. Definitions</p>

			<p>
				In these Terms:
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Non-fungible token” “NFT”</span>: Non-fungible token is a commercial term to describe items like your furniture, a picture image file, or your laptop. These things are not interchangeable for other items because they have unique properties. NFTs are tokens that we can use to represent ownership of unique items. They let us tokenize things like art, collectibles, even real estate. They can only have one official owner at a time and they're secured by the NEAR blockchain – no one can modify the record of ownership or copy/paste a new NFT into existence.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span>“Fungible items”</span>: on the other hand, can be exchanged because their value defines them rather than their unique properties.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span>“Applicable Law”</span>: any law, rule, statute, subordinate legislation, regulation, by-law order, ordinance, protocol, code, guideline, treaty, policy, notice, direction or judicial, arbitral, administrative, ministerial or departmental judgment, award, decree, treaty, directive, or other requirement or guideline published or in force at any time which applies to or is otherwise intended to govern or regulate any person (including all parties to this Terms), property, transaction, activity, event or other matter, including any rule, order, judgment, directive or other requirement or guideline issued by any governmental or regulatory authority;
			</p>

			<p>
				<span>“Sale Item”</span> means any one or more of the following without limitation:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) any art (including without limitation, designs, drawings, prints, images in any form or media, including without limitation videos and photographs);
				</li>
